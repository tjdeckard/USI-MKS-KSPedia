          <Text>USI Life Support introduces three new resources 
(and uses one stock resource)

Supplies - kerbals need them to survive
ElectricCharge - kerbals need 0.01 EC/s
Mulch - Kerbals produce this as waste when
they consume Supplies
Fertilizer - greenhouses can convert a combination
of Mulch and Fertilizer into Supplies</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text Name="Heading (2)">
          <Text>Consumption

Each kerbal consumes Supplies. For every unit of Supplies they consume, kerbals produce one unit of Mulch as waste.

To reduce the rate at which kerbals convert Supplies to Mulch, you can use life support Recyclers. For longer missions, Converters may be used to produce Supplies from Mulch with the use of Fertilizer. Each unit of fertilizer is equal to 3.14 Kerbal-hours of Supplies (at the default 8.5:1 conversion ratio).

Recyclers

Recyclers can reduce the rate of consumption of Supplies. Each Recycler has an efficiency and a crew capacity. For example, the stock MPL Science Lab can reduce consumption by 70% (efficiency) for up to five kerbals (crew capacity). After the crew capacity is exceeded, the efficiency is reduced by the amount you are over capacity. For example, the MPL Science Lab's efficiency divided by 2 if ten kerbals are present on the ship (double the Recycler's crew capacity).

If you have multiple Recyclers running, their effects are cumulative. The vessel-wide consumption reduction is capped by the most efficient recycler - so if your most efficient Recycler is a Science Lab, you can't reduce your Supplies consumption by more than 70%, no matter how many Recyclers are running.

Converters

USI-LS includes two greenhouses that can convert Mulch and Fertilizer into Supplies. By beginning your mission with a Converter, some Fertilizer, and only a small amount of initial Supplies, you can dramatically reduce the total mass of resources you need.

To calculate the amount of Fertilizer required, first calculate the total amount of Supplies required for your mission. Then divide this number by the "Supplies to Fertilizer Ratio". For example, if your mission will require 850 units of Supplies and you choose to utilize a Nom-O-Matic 5000, then you should pack 100 units of Fertilizer. With some small amount of Supplies to begin with (so that Mulch is produced), your greenhouse will add a bit of Fertilizer to your Mulch and produce 850 units of Supplies before running out of Fertilizer.

Also note the rate at which Converters produce Supplies. Multiple Converters may be necessary to produce the daily Supplies requirement for multiple kerbals. Converters work independent from one another so their effects are cumulative.</Text>

        </Text>
        <Text Name="Text (2)">
          <Text>All crewed modules provide a certain amount of Habitation, measured in "Kerbal-Months" (30 six-hour Kerbin-Days), equal to the number of seats on board. For example, the Mk1 Command Pod provides 1 kerbal-month of Habitation. More specialized parts may provide additional Habitation. For example, the Hitchhiker Can provides 660 kerbal-days of Habitation (in addition to the 28 kerbal-days provided by its 4 seats). Pilots and Scouts are immune to habitation values.

Habitat Multipliers

The kerbal-months provided by your habitat space is multiplied by the vessel's total Hab Multiplier value. Every vessel has a base Hab Multiplier of 1. Any additional multipliers provided by parts are added to that to get the vessel's final Hab Multiplier. For example, a Cupola has a Hab Multiplier of 1.76. If a vessel has two Cupolae, its final Hab Multiplier is 1 + (1.76 * 2) = 4.52. If the vessel provides a base Habitation of 100 kerbal-months, the Hab Multiplier increases the ship's total Habitation to 452 kerbal-months.

Habitation and Homesickness

Kerbals can only stay in a confined space away from home for so long before bad things happen. Each kerbal has two running clocks (displayed for each active kerbal in the USI-LS window) which determine this time limit.

Hab time- how long the kerbal will be happy on his current vessel
Home time- how long the kerbal will be happy before getting homesick for Kerbin.

Hab time is reset every time a kerbal enters a new vessel. It begins with the vessel's provided Habitatation time (divided by the number of kerbals present) and counts down to zero. The concept of Hab time is how comfortable your kerbal is with his current vessel. He can't live in tight spaces for long, and he gets tired of staying in the same place.

Home time never resets of it's own accord and starts counting down from the moment of launch. However, it is increased by the highest amount of Habitation ever experienced by the kerbal. The concept of Home time is how homesick the kerbal is. Spacious vessels will help him stay positive for a longer time, but eventually he's going to miss home. However, this timer can be reversed if there is a functioning colonization module present. See 'Med Bay &amp; Colony Supplies' for more info . . . 

For example, imagine we have a rocket (Habitation = 30 days) with an attached lander (Habitation = 5 days) and a space station (Habitation = 1000 days). When Jebediah launches (alone) his Hab time and Home time both start at 30 days and begin counting down. He arrives at the Mun 5 days later with a Hab time and Home time of 25 days each. Then he moves to the lander. His Home time will be unaffected (still 25 days, counting down), but his Hab time will be reset/decreased to 5 days (because the lander is only able to support a kerbal for 5 days). Jeb visits the surface of the Mun and returns to his ship in orbit after 4 days. At this point his Hab time is 1 day and his Home time is 21 days. When he moves back to the rocket his Hab time will reset to 30 days, but his Home time will remain at 21 days. Jebediah then travels to the space station for 10 days (Hab = 20 days, Home = 11 days). When he enters the space station, Hab time is reset to 1000 days (a nice new station for him to stretch his legs in). His Home time is also increased, but not to 1000. He has already been away from home for 19 days at this point, which means his Home time will be reset to 981 days (29 days shy of 1000). After 100 days on the station he boards the rocket again (Hab goes down to 30, Home is unaffected and at 951) and heads back to Kerbin, where he is recovered.</Text>

          <Text>In MKS, Logistics is the process of moving things from one vessel (the Warehouse) to another (the Consumer). This can happen via many different methods each with their own ranges and requirements, but all logistics use the same basic mechanism.

Regardless of the specific method's range, a few things must be true. The Consumer must have the LogisticsConsumer module, the Warehouse must have the ResourceWarehouse module, and they must be within range.

Consumers will also only request resources if they are below 50%, will never request more than 10% of their capacity at a time, will never request Machinery, and will only request EC if they are hooked up into a proper Power Coupling/Distribution network. See 'Power' for more info . . .</Text>

          <Text>Pioneer Modules may now perform a Resource Scan which will identify nearby 'Resource Lodes'.  These are physical objects that must be grappled, at which point both the Range and Tundra regolith sifters can convert the ResourceLode resource into a variety of other resources based on planetary composition (similar to how Dirt works today). These however cannot be converted when the craft is not focused, hence ‘Active’. Larger resources can also be found using the ‘Orbital Survey Scanner’, these are 100 times the size of local nodes and will require you to either travel long distances with  your equipment or bring the resource lode to your base in inventive ways. On larger bodies the local resource lodes will spawn at distance greater than the 2km resource range of the Karibou Rover Cab. You can invent your own methods for moving these beasts. Umbra Space Industries take no responsibility for any damage to Rover Cabs caused by excessive ramming.

          <Text>Here is an example craft. Notice;
Karibou configurable Kontainers so that we can choose from any of the MKS resources to sift from the resource lode.
 We can also use ‘Local Logistics’ to push resources to a nearby base up to 2km.
The microwave power receiver to provide wireless power transfer from nearby bases up to 2km.
The Karibou VTOL engines allow us to ‘bunny hop’ between lodes.
The Karibou Rover Cab extends our Logistics range to 2km.
The ‘Ranger’ Sifter allows us to convert the resource lode.
The Docking Claw on the rear to allow us to grapple the lode. You can also use KIS pipes or FlexOTubes.

          <Text>Building large or multiple MKS bases can become very expensive very quickly in a KSP career mode. As a result of this many players utilize the process of refining and manufacturing with various MKS parts. All of the raw resources can be harvested and processed into a series of increasingly valuable finished goods. Many of these goods vary in how valuable they are including a couple that are considered rare resources. Any resource produced by any one of the many MKS parts can be loaded on a Spacecraft and shipped back to Kerbin where the Spacecraft and the resources onboard can be recovered for extra funds. This can be a very helpful way to fund the building of large bases, or even multiple bases in the Kerbin system.</Text>

          <Text>Overview
Once you have processed your raw materials into refined materials you can the use these to manufacture MaterialKits, SpecializedParts or Colony Supplies. You can then use these to keep your colonies vital supplies stocked.
Workshop and Assembly Plant Modules will require a Kerbal with the engineer effect to be present in the vessel for peak operation (based on star level).
Agriculture Modules will require a Kerbal with the science effect to be present in the vessel for peak operation (based on star level).
All processes require their parts to be filled with machinery to reach 100% efficiency and will slowly consume machinery while outputting recyclables. Processes substituting Dirt for Substrate are much less efficient.</Text>

Once established in an acceptable orbit, deploy the scanner and perform a scan. This will give you a basic idea of what resources are present, and where higher and lower concentrations are, though its not highly detailed.

Turn on the overlays in map mode, and find a spot that is bright in things you care about to choose an area for further exploration.

Land a rover with the narrow band scanner in the spot you chose.
Take a surface reading.

Look at narrow band scanner UI, find a spot with better concentrations of things you care about, drive/hop there
Repeat until you are feeling good and have found a suitable spot for your mining.

Land your base as close as you can to your rover.

          <Text>Available Resources In Game:

Chemicals
Produced from Minerals. A component of MaterialKits and RefinedExotics.

ColonySupplies
Represents medical supplies, recreational materials, and luxury goods. Produced from MaterialKits, SpecializedParts, and Organics. Expended to lengthen or reset the habitation timers of kerbals.

DepletedFuel
Nuclear fuel that has been used up. Produced as a waste product by reactors. Can be bred back to EnrichedUranium at a loss.

Dirt
Miscellaneous junk mined from the ground. Used to grow Supplies or Organics; or sifted to extract low quantities of all other mineable resources, based on planetary average availability.

EnrichedUranium
Nuclear fuel ready for use. Consumed by reactors to produce ElectricCharge and DepletedFuel (and very small quantities of XenonGas). Centrifuged from raw Uraninite, or bred from DepletedFuel at a loss.

ExoticMinerals
A raw material that can be mined. A component of RefinedExotics.

Fertilizer
Food for plants. Produced from Gypsum or Minerals. A component of Supplies and Organics.

Gypsum
A raw material that can be mined. Crushed to produce Fertilizer.

Hydrates
A raw material that can be mined. Processed into Water.

Karbonite
A raw material that can be mined. Primarily used in the Karbonite mod to produce fuel. Can also be processed into Water.

LqdHydrogen
A type of fuel used by the mods CryoEngines and KerbalAtomics. See those mods for details on cryogenic storage. MKS includes several Kontainers that can be used as cryogenic storage if CryoTanks is installed; it also adds an option to the ISRU converter to split Water into LqdHydrogen and Oxidizer.

Machinery
Most modules must be filled with Machinery to operate at full efficiency; filling them partially with Machinery will result in partial efficiency. Those modules slowly consume their Machinery, producing Recyclables as a waste product. Produced from MaterialKits and SpecializedParts.

MaterialKits
Produced from Chemicals, Metals, and Polymers. A component of ColonySupplies and Machinery. If ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads is installed with MKS, MaterialKits are the primary component of vessels constructed off-world.

MetallicOre
A raw material mined from the ground. Used to produce Metals.

Metals
Produced from MetallicOre. A component of MaterialKits.

Minerals
A raw material mined from the ground. Used to produce Chemicals.

Mulch
Produced by kerbals as waste when they consume Supplies. Combined with Fertilizer to grow more Supplies.

Organics
Advanced crops. Produced from Fertilizer, Water, and either Substrate or Dirt; note that a small amount of Organics is required as a "seed crop." A component of ColonySupplies.

Polymers
Produced from Substrate. Used to produce MaterialKits.

RareMetals
A raw material that can be mined. A component of RefinedExotics.

Recyclables
Produced by converters as waste when they consume Machinery. Can be recycled into Chemicals, Metals, and Polymers.

RefinedExotics
Produced from Chemicals, ExoticMinerals, and RareMetals. A component of SpecializedParts.

Silicates
A raw material that can be mined. Used to produce Silicon.

SpecializedParts
Advanced electronics. Produced from RefinedExotics and Silicon. A component of ColonySupplies and Machinery. If Extraplanetary Launchpads is installed with MKS, SpecializedParts are a secondary component of vessels constructed off-world.

Substrate
A raw material that can be mined. Used to produce Polymers, or as a component of Supplies and Organics.

Supplies
Represents the food, water, and oxygen that kerbals require. If USI Life Support is installed, kerbals will consume Supplies and produce Mulch as waste. Produced from Mulch and Fertilizer; or from Fertilizer, Water, and either Dirt or Substrate.

Uraninite
A raw material that can be mined. Centrifuged into EnrichedUranium.

Water
A raw material that can be mined, or produced from Hydrates. Used to grow Supplies and Organics. Can also be used in high-efficiency recyclers to greatly reduce the Supplies that kerbals consume. Can be split in the ISRU into LqdHydrogen and Oxidizer.</Text>

          <Text>Tips for building bases.
Any Kerbal can move parts, but has a weight limitation (one tonne). You can move heavier parts with multiple Kerbals in range (one more tonne for each Kerbal). You can't move parts with other parts attached to them. Changing anchor point can be really useful to place the 'Ranger' Flex-O-Tube in the correct orientation.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text Name="Heading (18)">
          <Text>Konstruction and KAS
The Konstruction parts add increased weight limits and ranges to the KAS abilities. The PAL Crane, the PAL Grabber &amp; the PAL Fork all include this mechanic. This comes in really useful for building large bases.

          <Text>Resource Detection</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text Name="Heading (15)">
          <Text>The resource detection generally used is the same stock resource detection method in KSP, and used in the same manner as for stock Ore, except we will be looking for different resources.
The stock system uses the same 3 parts to accomplish a full analysis of resources present on any planetary body in the Kerbol System. The M700 Survey Scanner and M4435 Narrow-Band Scanner are stock parts that can be used in a polar orbit to locate surface resources and concentrations and display them as an overlay on the map.
Simply put them in an acceptable orbit of the planetary body you wish to scan and then select the scanner on the vessel and cycle through which resource to display.
It will offer every resource it is capable of scanning for acess this information using Kerbnet.

The M700 is used to give a general idea of what resources are present, while the M4435 can also be used while landed and is used to give a slightly more detailed idea of how much is present. To get more exact readings on how high of a concentration of a resource is actually present, a Surface scanner such as the stock Surface Scanning Module must be used while landed. The stock surface scanner now shows data for all relevant resources - enjoy prospecting!

UKS also works with SCANsat which offers a more immersive resource scanning experience and more detailed mapping options. Its a slightly more complex method than stock and has a few different options on how it can function.

See 'Scanning' for a step by step approach that outlines an approach to finding a nice area for resource extraction and base construction, as well as a few tips on what to look for in a site.

Things to look for in a site

Gypsum and Minerals will alow you to indefinitely extend your life support.
Either Ore or Karbonite is essential if you want to launch again, since you'll need a supply of LFO.
MetalicOre, Substrate, &amp; Minerals, in roughly equal quantities. All that matters is the lowest of the three, since that'll govern your industrial production.
RareMetals, ExoticMinerals &amp; Silicate in roughly equal quantities if you plan on increasing your industrial production to ship building and onsite construction.
Uraninite will be essential for advanced bases but can be ignored in your initial base.
Landing near (within 100 meters of) a biome border allows you to use proxy logistics to mine from 2 different biomes in one base. making a finding a high yield site easier/possible.</Text>

          <Text>You will eventually get into a position where their bases will need to be supported by extra resources. The easiest, best, and most cost effective way to supply your UKS bases will be to find and extract resources from the planetary body you build your ground base on. See 'Mining &amp; Manufacturing' for more info . . . 

You will need to use these extracted resources to keep their bases supplied if you want little or no extra shipments from Kerbin. This is also an effective way to support an Oribtal base in the same SOI the farther away they venture from Kerbin, reducing the need to send and wait for shipments from Kerbin.

On the next page is some information on where resources can be found in the environment, as well as how to detect and find these resources, and how to extract these resources with MKS parts. </Text>

Weldable, configurable construction ports, with auto-rotation and configurable parameters on the fly. Once connected, these can be removed, resulting in a permanent joint between the parent parts of the two ports.

Design your assembly in the VAB, cut it up and add construction ports, reassemble in-situ.

Great for large bases and stations, or building larger vessels in orbit!

          <Text>Inflatables are designed as lightweight shells that need to be inflated and filled with equipment before they are useful. MaterialKits can be 'Scavanged' see Logistics for more info...

This necessitates more launches but allows for smaller payloads which is useful early on in your space career.

The equipment is made on site and instantly using MaterialKits by an Engineer on EVA. When you are on EVA in the part action window you will find the deploy button available. You will get a warning if enough MaterialKits are not available.

          <Text>Inflatables are designed as lightweight shells that need to be inflated and filled with equipment before they are useful. MaterialKits can be 'Scavanged' see Logistics for more info...

This necessitates more launches but allows for smaller payloads which is useful early on in your space career.

The equipment is made on site and instantly using MaterialKits by an Engineer on EVA. When you are on EVA in the part action window you will find the deploy button available. You will get a warning if enough MaterialKits are not available.

The Inflatable Storage Modules do not require any MaterialKits to deploy and are deployed from within the craft.</Text>

          <Text>Efficiency &amp; Load </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text Name="Heading (1)">
          <Text>There are two types of efficiency in a MKS system. One is economic efficiency. Economic efficiency is the ratio of how one resource gets converted into another resource. The stock ISRU part will convert Ore into MonoPropellant among other things. It will consume 0.5 Ore and 30 ElectricCharge, and produce 1.0 MonoPropellant and do that every second. The economic efficiency of this conversion could be stated as 1 Ore: 2 MonoPropellant, and we'll ignore ElectricCharge here because we'll assume we're working in an environment where solar panels provide us with limitless ElectricCharge. The economic efficiency doesn't tell us how quickly we can convert Ore to MonoPropellant, just that we'll need one unit of the former to produce two units of the latter.

There is also a workload efficiency which is what governs the throughput of the conversion. The ISRU part could produce as much as 1.0 MonoPropellant per second from 0.5 Ore per second, but it can't produce more. That would be the 100% workload efficient state of the IRSU. It could produce less, though. If your drill is only extracting 0.25 Ore per second, you could only produce 0.5 MonoPropellant per second. You have a 50% workload efficiency. If you need more than 1.0 MonoPropellant per second, you'll need a 2nd ISRU. Stock component conversions can range from 0% to 100% workload efficiency and are only limited by constraining the supply of input resources (the Ore or the ElectricCharge in this case) or by having no place to store the output resources in the case of a conversion that doesn't dump excess.

MKS economic efficiency works exactly as stock all the time. However, it has a more complex system for workload efficiency. MKS converters cannot operate unmanned, and their workload efficiency varies based on the overall structure of your station and of the Kerbals that operate it. You can have workload efficiencies below 100%, even when you have an abundance of input resources and plenty of space to store your output, and you can have workload efficiencies above 100% by having a well-designed vessel and a well selected crew.

MKS also adds a further mechanic using Machinery. MKS converters cannot operate without Machinery and their output is directly related to amount of Machinery present. This is called Load.

Load is the overall productivity of a module including workload efficiency and economic efficiency, a 100% load uses normal production rates.

The capacity of machinery in the part is important. With only 50% machinery stored, the part will work at half speed.</Text>

          <Text>Ship building require ExtraPlanetary Luanchpads.

To build, you need three things:

Either the Orbital Shipyard, the Mobile Launch Platform, or a module Equipped with an ELSurveyStation &amp; Survey Stakes.

An on-board supply of MaterialKits &amp; SpecialzedParts. You don't need the full supply at once, so you can top it up as construction proceeds.

A crew of reasonably smart kerbals. Put your smart kerbals where they will do the most good (e.g. the workshop) and your stupid kerbals where they will do the least harm (e.g. command pods).

You can right-click on any crewed part and see its "efficiency" to see how good your Kerbal placement is. The higher your ship's total efficiency, the faster you build.

To build, right-click on your builder part (e.g. the Orbital Shipyard), open the construction window, then pick the desired ship from the VAB, SPH, or subassembly lists.

You'll be given the expected resource costs for the ship. Only the MaterialKits &amp; SpecialzedParts cost matters at first. Once the ship's hull is finished, the same window will pop up and you can choose to transfer resources such as fuel.

That should be enough to get you started.
